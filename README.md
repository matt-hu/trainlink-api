# TrainLink API
 This is an API to intergrate with a DCC++ (or DCC++ EX) BaseStation. It provides a simple way to control it over your local network, with multiple instances supported. This means if you open a website using TrainLink on two devices connected to the same server, they will be kept in sync!

 ## What is in this Repository?
 In this repository you will find the following (the sublist shows supported platforms, whilst ones in italic are planned for the future):
* The API Server
    * Python (Cross-platform)
    * _Arduino_
* The API Library
    * Javascript (Cross-platform)
    * _Arduino_
    * _Python_
* A Demo page

## Why should I use TrainLink?
One of the major features of trainlink is the cross-platform nature of the API. The server runs on Python, meaning it can be run on most platforms. Also, the API library is written in Javascript, so again, it can be run on most platforms.

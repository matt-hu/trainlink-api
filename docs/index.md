## Welcome to TrainLink!
Welcome to the TrainLink website. TrainLink is a brand new technology that allows throttles and other software to communicate with DCC controllers over a WiFi or LAN. This gives users flexibility over how they use their model railways.

TrainLink is fully open source under the GNU GPL v3 license. What this means is you can use the provided TrainLink code for anythin you want, including commercial use, as long as you use the same license (GNU GPL v3). This license has been chosen as it encourages developers to contribute to the open source communtiy.

## What hardware is supported?
Currently, TrainLink supports all of the DCC++ versions ([Classic](https://github.com/DCC-EX/BaseStation-Classic), [DCC++ EX](https://github.com/DCC-EX/BaseStation-EX), [CommandStation EX](https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX)). It is recommended to use DCC++ EX, although this will switch to CommandStation once a stable version is reached.

The reason these are the only ones supported is simple, the way to communicate with them is open source. If you know of another open-source DCC base station, please open an issue on GitHub and we wil try and support it.

# Trainlink Specifications

This folder contains all of the specifications for making Trainlink compatable software. If you are using one of the Trainlink libraries, please use [high-level.md](https://github.com/trainlink-org/trainlink-api/blob/master/specifications/high-level.md). 
However, if you are writing a client library or a server, please use [client.md](https://github.com/trainlink-org/trainlink-api/blob/master/specifications/low-level/client.md) and [server.md](https://github.com/trainlink-org/trainlink-api/blob/specs/specifications/low-level/server.md) in the low-level folder respectively.

Within each specification there are a number of 'modules' that you can use. Some are compulsary, wheras some are optional (this will make sense when you start reading). Also, within each 'module' there are features that make up that module. Again, some of the features must be included for your software to be Trainlink compatible, some are optional.

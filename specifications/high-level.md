# Trainlink specification - User-facing client (High level)
*Version 0.3.0*

This is the specification to use if you are writing a user-facing interface using a Trainlink client library.


Within this specification there are a number of 'modules' that you can use. Some are compulsary, wheras some are optional (this will make sense when you start reading). Also, within each 'module' there are features that make up that module. Again, some of the features must be included for your software to be Trainlink compatible, some are optional.

## Module overview
This is an overview of the modules that make up a Trainlink implementation. See further down for more detailed information on the features that make up a module.

**Compulsary modules:**

- Point motors
